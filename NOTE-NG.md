This application runs perectly on my local computer but there is a problem when I try to publish it to Github.


when I use npm run deploy I get the following result


Failed to compile.

[eslint]
src\Menu.js
  Line 10:5:   'setSrc' is not defined  no-undef
  Line 10:12:  'VIDEOS' is not defined  no-undef

Search for the keywords to learn more about each error.







I need to investigate this further
